A 3D orbital simulation with nice glitch

[strainer.github.io/novaglitch/](https://strainer.github.io/novaglitch/)

In this simulation are 7 gravitational bodies and about 20 thousand colored specks.

The gravity function is bugged so orbiting specks and bodies implode on the main body.
Another function chops the specks into small groups and squeezes them a little which
makes the specks slightly sticky over time. This function is also bugged and causes
the specks to rapidly expand on accidental frames.
The overall result is a flickering glitch containing sometimes curious forms.
